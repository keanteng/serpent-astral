The galactic most trusted shop for your Astral's need. A hobby project to learn how to set up a simple shop with [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database. The UI for the page is powered by [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Chakra UI](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/).

A shop system is massive CRUD processes at work, I plan to learn most of the functions to make it work from populating the databases to display the data then with user interacting with it - a monumental feat!

## Getting Started

After Git clonning,

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can also use my script for fast deployement, make sure your Prisma is configured first:

```bash
./npm_auto.sh
```

## 🪫Progress

- Create data ✔️
- Delete data ✔️
- Update data ✔️
- Retrieve data ✔️
- Study the API route and rework the components and UI for better project scaling - thee're scattering everywhere. Works on datatype for standaridzation as well ❌
- Data refresh on delete ❌


## Inspiration

The project aims to study the inventory management system 😆. I am quite inspired by Manhwa with all the overpowered system, so I kinda bring their concepts to create this shop.
